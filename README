NAME
    Imager::Bing::MapLayer - create a map layer for Bing Maps

VERSION
    Version v0.1.2

SYNOPSIS
        my $layer = Imager::Bing::MapLayer->new(
          base_dir           => $dir,     # base directory (default '.')
          overwrite          => 1,        # overwrite existing (default)
          autosave           => 1,        # save on exit (default)
          in_memory          => 0,        # keep tiles in memory (default false)
          min_level          => 1,        # min zoom level (default)
          max_level          => 19,       # max zoom level (default)
          combine            => 'darken', # tile composition method (default)
        );

        # Plot polygons (e.g. geographic boundaries)

        $layer->polygon(
           points => $points,                  # listref to [ lat, lon ] points
           fill   => Imager::Fill->new( ... ), #
        );

        # Plot greyscale gradient circles for heatmaps

        $layer->radial_circle(
            r      => 100,              # radius in meters
            -min_r => 1,                # minimum pixel radius for any zoom level
            x      => $longitude,       # longitude (x = east-west)
            y      => $latitude,        # latitude  (y = north-south)
        );

        # Blur filter

        $layer->filter( type => 'gaussian', stddev => 1 );

        # Colourise greyscale heatmaps

        $layer->colourise();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper around the Imager::Draw module, which allows
    you to create Bing map layers using longitude and latitude coordinates.

    The module will automatically map them to the appropriate points on tile
    files.
