=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a wrapper around the L<Imager::Draw> module, which
allows you to create Bing map layers using longitude and latitude
coordinates.

The module will automatically map them to the appropriate points on
tile files.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=cut

# We want to center our conversions of lat/lon to London.

const my $LONDON_LATITUDE  => 51.5171;
const my $LONDON_LONGITUDE => 0.1062;

=head2 C<base_dir>

The base directory to save tile files in.

=cut

has 'base_dir' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => subtype( as 'Str', where { -d $_ }, ),
    default => sub { return getcwd; },
);

=head2 C<in_memory>

The timeout for how many seconds a tile is kept in memory.

When a tile is timed out, it is saved to disk after each L<Imager> drawing
operation, and reloaded if it is later needed.

=cut

has 'in_memory' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => subtype( as 'Int', where { ( $_ >= 0 ) }, ),
    default => sub { return 0; },
);

=head2 C<centroid_latitude>

This is the default latitude for translating points to pixels.
Generally you don't need to worry about this.

=cut

has 'centroid_latitude' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Num',
    default => sub { return $LONDON_LATITUDE },
);

=head2 C<centroid_longitude>

This is the default longitude for translating points to pixels.
Generally you don't need to worry about this.

=cut

has 'centroid_longitude' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Num',
    default => sub { return $LONDON_LONGITUDE },
);

=head2 C<overwrite>

When true (default), existing tiles will be overwritten rather than
edited.

Be wary of editing existing tiles, since antialiased lines and opaque
fills will darken existing points rather than drawing over them.

=cut

has 'overwrite' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => sub { return 1; },
);

=head2 C<autosave>

When true (default), tiles will be automatically saved.

Alternatively, you can use the L</save> method.

=cut

has 'autosave' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => sub { return 1; },
);

=head2 C<combine>

The tile combination method. It defaults to C<darken>.

=cut

has 'combine' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Str',
    default => sub { return 'darken'; },
);

=head2 C<tile_class>

The base class used for tiles.

=cut

has 'tile_class' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => tile_class_type(),
    default => sub { 'Imager::Bing::MapLayer::Tile' },
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<levels>

  my @levels = @{ $layer->levels };

This returns a reference to a list of
L<Imager::Bing::MapLayer::Level> objects.

=cut

has 'levels' => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'ArrayRef',
    lazy    => 1,
    default => sub {
        my ($self) = @_;

        confess "min_level > max_level"
            if ( $self->min_level > $self->max_level );

        my @levels;

        foreach my $level ( $self->min_level .. $self->max_level ) {
            push @levels,
                Imager::Bing::MapLayer::Level->new(
                level              => $level,
                base_dir           => $self->base_dir,
                centroid_latitude  => $self->centroid_latitude,
                centroid_longitude => $self->centroid_longitude,
                overwrite          => $self->overwrite,
                autosave           => $self->autosave,
                in_memory          => $self->in_memory,
                combine            => $self->combine,
                tile_class         => $self->tile_class,
                );
        }

        return \@levels;
    },
);

=head2 C<min_level>

The minimum zoom level to generate.

=cut

has 'min_level' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => subtype(
        as 'Int',
        where { ( $_ >= $MIN_ZOOM_LEVEL ) && ( $_ <= $MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL ) }
    ),
    default => sub {$MIN_ZOOM_LEVEL},
);

=head2 C<max_level>

The maximum zoom level to generate.

=cut

has 'max_level' => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => subtype(
        as 'Int',
        where { ( $_ >= $MIN_ZOOM_LEVEL ) && ( $_ <= $MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL ) }
    ),
    default => sub {$MAX_ZOOM_LEVEL},
);

=begin internal

=head2 C<_make_imager_wrapper_method>

    __PACKAGE__->_make_imager_wrapper_method( { name => $method } );

This is an I<internal> method for generating wrapper L<Imagers::Draw>
methods that are applied to every level.

These methods use latitude and longitude in lieau of C<y> and C<x>
parameters.  Note that C<points> parameters contain pairs of latitude
and longitude coordinates, I<not> longitude and latitude coordinates!

See L<Imager::Draw> for documentation of the methods.

We've added the following additional arguments:

=over

=item C<-min_level>

The minimum zoom level to draw on.

=item C<-max_level>

The maximum zoom level to draw on.

=back

=end internal

=cut

sub _make_imager_wrapper_method {
    my ( $class, $opts ) = @_;

    $opts->{args} //= [];

    $class->meta->add_method(

        $opts->{name} => sub {

            my ( $self, %args ) = @_;

            foreach my $level ( @{ $self->levels } ) {

                my $method = $level->can( $opts->{name} );

                $level->$method(%args);

            }

            }

    );
}

=head2 C<radial_circle>

    $layer->radial_circle(
        r      => $radius_in_meters,
        -min_r => $min_radius_in_pixels,
        x      => $longitude,
        y      => $latitude,
    );

This method plots "fuzzy" greyscale circles, which are intended to be
used for heatmaps.  The radius is scaled appropriately for each zoom
level in the layer.

If C<-min_r> is specified, then a circle will always be drawn with
that minimum radius: this ensures that lower zoom levels will always
have a point plotted.

=head2 C<colourise>

    $layer->colourise();

The method colourises greyscale layers.  It is intended to be used for
heatmaps generated using the L</radial_circle> method.

=head2 C<filter>

    $layer->filter( type => 'gaussian', stddev => 1 );

This applies L<Imager::Filters> to every tile on every zoom level of the layer.

Be aware that some filter effects may enhance the edges of tiles in
each zoom level.

=head2 C<setpixel>

Draw a pixel at a specific latitude and longitude coordinate.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<line>

Draw a line between two coordinates.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<box>

Draw a box bounded by northwest and southeast coordinates.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<polyline>

Draw a polyline for a set of coordinates.

Note that a polyline is not closed. To draw a closed area, use the
L</polygon> method.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<polygon>

Draw a closed polygon for a set of coordinates.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<arc>

Draw an arc.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<circle>

Draw a circle.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<string>

Draw a text string.

TODO - the size is not scaled.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

=head2 C<align_string>

Draw an aligned text string.

TODO - the size is not scaled.

See the corresponding method in L<Imager::Draw> for more information.

Save the tiles.

=cut

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

For plotting very large polylines and polygons, the system will die
with no error message.
